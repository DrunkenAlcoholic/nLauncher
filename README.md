# NimLaunch

Lightning-fast, X11-native application and command launcher written in Nim.
Pure Xlib/Xft rendering, instant fuzzy search, rich themes, and zero toolkit
dependencies.

---

## Features

- **Instant fuzzy search** â€“ typo-tolerant scoring that favours prefixes, word
  boundaries, and recent launches.
- **Keyboard-first workflow** â€“ arrow keys or Vim-style navigation, quick
  command prefixes (`:s`, `:c`, `:t`, `:r`, `:p`, `!`), plus custom shortcuts.
- **Small & native** â€“ no GTK/Qt; just Nim, Xlib, and Xft.
- **Smart filesystem search** â€“ `:s` uses `fd` when available, falls back to
  `locate`, then a bounded walk under `$HOME`.
- **Themeable** â€“ 25+ bundled themes with instant `:t` preview and easy TOML tweaks.
- **Single-instance guard** â€“ second launch exits immediately instead of
  spawning duplicate windows.

## Installation

### Prebuilt binary

Download the latest release from
[`releases/`](https://github.com/DrunkenAlcoholic/NimLaunch/releases) and run
`./bin/nimlaunch`. Ensure your system provides the `libX11` and `libXft`
shared libraries (Wayland sessions require XWayland).

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrunkenAlcoholic/NimLaunch.git
cd NimLaunch
nimble install --depsOnly # optional: install dependencies declared in the nimble file
nimble release           # produces ./bin/nimlaunch
./bin/nimlaunch
```

Dependencies:

- **Nim toolchain** â€“ install via [choosenim](https://nim-lang.org/install_unix.html)
  or your package manager.
- **Development headers** â€“ `libx11` and `libxft` (`libx11-dev libxft-dev` on
  Debian/Ubuntu; `libx11 libxft` on Arch/Manjaro).
- **Nim packages** â€“ already covered by `nimble install` above (`parsetoml`, `x11`).

Command-line flag:

- `--bench` â€“ prints millisecond startup timings and exits.

## Everyday Usage

| Key / Pattern                | Action |
| ---------------------------- | ------ |
| Type text                    | Fuzzy-search installed applications |
| Enter                        | Launch selected item |
| Esc                          | Close NimLaunch |
| â†‘ / â†“ / PgUp / PgDn / Home / End | Navigate the list |
| `:t`                         | Open theme list (Up/Down previews instantly; Enter saves) |
| `:s query`                   | Search files (`fd` â†’ `locate` â†’ home walk) |
| `:c query`                   | Open matching files under `~/.config` |
| `:r command` or `!command`   | Run shell command in your preferred terminal |
| `:p` (customisable)          | Show configured power/system actions |

Results from `:s` render as `filename â€” /path/to/dir` and open with the system
handler. Power actions can either spawn in the background or run inside your
configured terminal.

### Vim mode

Enable by setting `[input].vim_mode = true` in `~/.config/nimlaunch/nimlaunch.toml`.
Vim mode adds:

- `h/j/k/l`, `gg`, and `Shift+G` navigation.
- Slash (`/`), colon (`:`), and bang (`!`) open the bottom command line.
- `:q` exits. `Esc` closes the command line and **restores** your previous query
  if you cancel.
- `Ctrl+H` deletes one character; `Ctrl+U` clears the command line.

## Configuration

The config lives at `~/.config/nimlaunch/nimlaunch.toml`. It is auto-generated
on first run, shipping with sensible defaults and a long list of themes.

```toml
[window]
width = 500
max_visible_items = 10
center = true
vertical_align = "one-third"

[font]
fontname = "Noto Sans:size=12"

[input]
prompt   = "> "
cursor   = "_"
vim_mode = false

[terminal]
program = "kitty"

[border]
width = 2

[[shortcuts]]
prefix = ":g"            # write "g", ":g", or "g:" â€” all map to :g in the UI
label  = "Search Google: "
base   = "https://www.google.com/search?q={query}"
mode   = "url"            # other options: "shell", "file"

[power]
prefix = ":p"            # write with or without ':'; the UI trigger remains :p

[[power_actions]]
label   = "Shutdown"
command = "systemctl poweroff"
mode    = "spawn"         # or "terminal"
stay_open = false

[[themes]]
name                = "Nord"
bgColorHex          = "#2E3440"
fgColorHex          = "#D8DEE9"
highlightBgColorHex = "#88C0D0"
highlightFgColorHex = "#2E3440"
borderColorHex      = "#4C566A"
matchFgColorHex     = "#f8c291"

[theme]
last_chosen = "Nord"
```

Shortcut and power prefixes are stored case-insensitively without leading/trailing
colons, so feel free to write `g:`, `:g`, or just `g`. At runtime you still press
`:` followed by the keyword (for example `:g search terms`).

### Custom shortcuts

Add more `[[shortcuts]]` blocks:

```toml
[[shortcuts]]
prefix = "yt:"
label  = "Search YouTube: "
base   = "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query={query}"

[[shortcuts]]
prefix = "rg"
label  = "grep repo: "
base   = "cd ~/code && rg {query}"
mode   = "shell"

[[shortcuts]]
prefix = ":note"
label  = "Open note: "
base   = "~/notes/{query}.md"
mode   = "file"
```

`mode = "shell"` quotes the query for a shell command, while `mode = "file"`
expands `~` and launches the path with your default handler. If the file is
missing, NimLaunch stays open so you can adjust the query.

### Power actions

`[[power_actions]]` entries expose shutdown/reboot/lock/etc. commands behind a
keyword (default `:p`). Each action supports:

- `label` â€“ text shown in the list.
- `command` â€“ shell command executed via `/bin/sh -c`.
- `mode` â€“ `spawn` (background) or `terminal` (run inside the configured terminal).
- `stay_open` â€“ keep NimLaunch open after execution.

Set `[power].prefix = "x"` (or clear it) to change or disable the trigger.

## File discovery & caching

NimLaunch indexes `.desktop` files from:

1. `~/.local/share/applications`
2. `~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications`
3. `/usr/share/applications`
4. `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications`

Metadata is cached at `~/.cache/nimlaunch/apps.json`. The cache is invalidated
automatically when source directories change. Entries flagged as `NoDisplay=true`,
`Terminal=true`, or belonging solely to the `Settings` / `System` categories are
skipped so the list remains focused on launchable apps.

Recent launches are tracked in `~/.cache/nimlaunch/recent.json`, ensuring the
empty-query view always surfaces the last applications you opened.

---

## Themes

- `:t` shows the theme list; move with Up/Down to preview instantly and press Enter to keep the selection.
  Leaving `:t` without pressing Enter restores the theme you started with.
- Add or edit `[[themes]]` blocks in the TOML to create your own colour schemes.

Popular presets include Nord, Catppuccin (all flavours), Ayu, Dracula, Gruvbox,
Solarized, Tokyo Night, Monokai, Palenight, and more.
